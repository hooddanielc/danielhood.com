          I'm a passionate software developer currently doing all that I can to better
          myself as a professional software engineer.

          I started programming when I was a teenager and have never stopped. I studied 
          software development in college for three years in Idaho and California, but I 
          have learned at least as much from working on programming projects on my own. 
          I've always been impatient with myself, always eager to learn how to write new 
          kinds of things. Programming keeps leading me forward.

          While a student 2012, I took a summer internship at Tagged in San Francisco. 
          It was the most concentrated learning experience of my life and launched my 
          career as a professional software developer. I stayed on at Tagged after my 
          internship, working as a contractor. It was also the place where I met the man 
          I married, so I can truly say it was a turning point in my life.

          Since then, I have been working in the Seattle area keeping the same mind set.
          Exposure to different development teams and work environments has helped me
          to gain perspective. I think good software development is object-oriented,
          test-driven, rapidly iterated, and as fully automated as possible. I hope
          my next team will build on these ideas and help me to grow and learn as a
          developer.
